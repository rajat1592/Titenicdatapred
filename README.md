# Titenicdatapred
Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, along with various attributes such as age, class, and ticket fare.

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the factors that influenced the survival of passengers on the Titanic. We will use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to visualize and understand patterns in the data, and then build predictive models to determine the likelihood of survival based on different features.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:

train.csv: The training set used to build our machine learning models.
test.csv: The test set, which will be used to evaluate the performance of our models.
Features
Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (target variable)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Analysis Steps
Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the relationships between different features and the target variable (Survived).

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of our machine learning models.

Model Building: Train machine learning models using the training set and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models on the test set and compare their performance to choose the best model.

Conclusion: Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis.
